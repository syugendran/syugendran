Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche said:

"I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and impossible.
The fact that something seems impossible shouldn't be a reason to not pursue it —
that's exactly what makes it worth pursuing.
Where would the courage and greatness be if success was certain and there was no risk?
The only true failure is shrinking away from life's challenges."

This is the line I live by.
This is why I build things that scare me.
This is why I choose firmware — the layer where excuses die and the machine tells the truth.

🧠 About Me

I’m a firmware engineer working on BIOS and Slim Bootloader (SBL) for next-generation Intel platforms.
Most days, I’m knee-deep in low-level debugging:
ACPI tables, DRAM init flows, GPIOv2 registers, power states (S0ix), and everything between UEFI and silicon.
Outside work, I rebuild my fundamentals, experiment with microcontrollers, and document my growth openly.
